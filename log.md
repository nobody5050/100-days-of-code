### Day 4: April 21, Tuesday

**Today's Preogress**: Spent most of the day working on homework, but did manage to get drafted for building a discord bot. (atleast helping) looked into replacing navbar with hamburger menu, and tbh I feel like much of the web design could use work. tomorrow i'm going to try write another blog post.
